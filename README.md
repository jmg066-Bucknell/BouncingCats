# BouncingCats

This is a website to host a p5 prject that I just recently learned, mostly from professor Meng. My p5js editor for this repository [https://editor.p5js.org/jmg066-Bucknell/full/A6nCSbxmtF]. Below is a screen shot of the program. Note the actual program generates a video where cats bounce around the screen, if they hit a wall they meow, and if you click they flip horizontally. 

The website that runs the program is at [https://jmg066-bucknell.github.io/BouncingCats/]
